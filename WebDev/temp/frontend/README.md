**Steps to start mongoDB**
âœ… Step 1: Get Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String
Go to MongoDB Atlas and log in.
Select your database cluster.
Click "Connect" â†’ "Connect your application".(compass/atlas, etc.)
Copy the connection string. It looks like this:
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Replace <username> and <password> with your actual MongoDB credentials.
âœ… Step 2: Store Your MongoDB URL in a .env File
âœ… Step 3: Install dotenv and Mongoose(if not installed)
npm install dotenv mongoose
âœ… Step 4: Connect MongoDB in server.js
âœ… Step 5: Start Your Node.js Server
node server.js
âœ… **Step 6: Verify Connection in MongoDB Compass**
Open MongoDB Compass.
Click "New Connection" and paste your MongoDB Atlas connection string (MONGO_URI).
Click "Connect".
You should see your database and collections.
âœ… Next Time You Start the Server

1. **authController.js** handling user authentication and generating a JWT token. It uses bcrypt.compare to verify the hashed password and ensures the token is generated securely.

Summary:
Login Function:

Finds the user by email.

Uses bcrypt.compare to verify the hashed password.

Generates a JWT token upon successful login.

Responds with the token or an error message.

Next Steps:
Please share the contents of your userController.js for further verification. ðŸ˜Š

Let's ensure everything is set up correctly!

2. **userController.js** handling various user-related operations such as registration, authentication, fetching user details, updating user details, and deleting users.

Summary:
