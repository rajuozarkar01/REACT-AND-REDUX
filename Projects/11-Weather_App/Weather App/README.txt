Weather App â€“ Fetch weather data from an API and display it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------   

Here's a simple React weather app that fetches weather data from an API (like OpenWeatherMap) and displays it. It uses React with Tailwind for styling and fetches data using `fetch`.

This app allows users to enter a city name and fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap. Let me know if you need any improvements! ðŸš€

-------------------------------------------------------------------
It looks like you're getting a "City not found" error. Here are a few things to check:
------------------
1. **Verify API Key**: Make sure you replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with a valid API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

2. **Check City Name**: Ensure that the city name is correctly spelled. The API might not recognize some smaller or misspelled locations.

3. **Use `console.log(data)`**: Add `console.log(data);` before setting the weather state to inspect the API response in the browser console.

4. **Try Different Cities**: Some city names might require more details, e.g., `"Mumbai, INDIA"` instead of just `"Mumbai"`.

5. **Check Network Requests**: Open your browser's developer console (F12 > Network) to see the exact API request and response.
